= Introduction and Motivation
Experts expect the quantum computing market to grow from USD 866 million in 2023 to USD 4.375 million in 2030 @QuantumComputingMarket2023.
Quantum computing is especially promising in the fields of simulations, drug development, and cybersecurity @emilioCurrentStatusNext2022.
Despite these optimistic prognoses, current quantum computers are still called Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices due to the high error and noise rates @preskillQuantumComputingNISQ2018.
Current quantum computers (QCs) are provided as cloud-based services to the user by startups such as Rigetti @RigettiQuantumComputing2024 or IonQ @CompareQuantumSystems2024 and tech giants like IBM @IBMQuantum2024, Microsoft @AzureQuantumQuantum2024 or Amazon @CloudQuantumComputing2024.
These services are mainly aimed at academics and researchers.
As a first step, a user must register an account using such a cloud-based quantum computer.
Afterward, the user develops the quantum circuit (e.g., in IBM's Qiskit @Qiskit2024), uploads the quantum circuit, and can choose a backend to execute the circuit on.
Next, the request gets scheduled and executed on the QC.
Finally, results are sent back to the user.
#figure(
  image("images/quantum-based-cloud-provider-trust-left-to-right.svg"),
  caption: "The user is sending the quantum circuit to the cloud-based quantum computing provider and has to trust the provider that the circuit is executed on an actual quantum computer."
) <cloud-trust>
In this cloud-based scenario, the user has to trust the cloud-based quantum provider to execute the quantum circuit on the advertised quantum hardware.
An adversarial cloud provider could claim to have a quantum computer backend, but all circuits are just simulated on a classical computer.
This scenario primarily affects small circuits due to the exponential growth in dimensions, rendering larger circuits impractical for computation with classical hardware.
// TODO quantum supremacy?? Ã¼berhaupt wichtig?
In 2020, a research team led by scientist Jian-Wei Pan at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) achieved quantum supremacy using 76 photons for the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm @garistoLightBasedQuantumComputer2021.
The samples generated in the study required 200 seconds, a task estimated to take a classical supercomputer 2.5 billion years to complete, as detailed in the paper @zhongQuantumComputationalAdvantage2020.
Quantum supremacy marks the point at which quantum computers outperform classical computers in specific tasks.
However, apart from these highly specialized setups, it is still possible to simulate small quantum circuits.
As of 2023, a rough cost estimate for a 9-qubit quantum computer from Rigetti stands at \$900,000 @mechanicRigettiLaunchesNovera2023.
Conversely, simulators can execute small circuits on consumer hardware, drastically reducing the cost barrier for executing quantum computations.
This cost consideration, coupled with the scalability limitations of classical hardware, underscores the significance of the threat posed by cloud quantum providers employing simulators, particularly in scenarios where the users are unaware of this substitution.
Therefore, mitigating strategies should be devised to ensure transparency and trust in quantum cloud services to safeguard against potential security breaches and ensure the integrity of quantum computations.

// TODO write in 3rd person?
// TODO Paper Contributions mehr herausarbeiten.
This work provides a machine learning-based approach that allows the users of cloud-based QCs to verify with high certainty that their quantum circuit has been executed on a quantum computer (and not simulated on a classical computer).

== Related Work <related-work>
Previous work has shown that it is possible to generate a unique hardware fingerprint based on the qubit frequencies. The fingerprint is based on quantum computer calibration data, which was made available by the cloud provider @smithFastFingerprintingCloudbased2022.
A different research group has developed a Quantum Physically Unclonable Function (QuPUF).
By utilizing the QuPUF, it is possible to identify the quantum computer the QuPUF was executed on @phalakQuantumPUFSecurity2021.
Another approach uses a tomography-based fingerprinting method based on crosstalk-induced errors @miShortPaperDevice2021.

Martina et al.'s paper "Noise fingerprints in quantum computers: Machine learning software tools" distinguishes which QC a specific quantum circuit has been executed by learning the error fingerprint using a support vector machine @martinaLearningNoiseFingerprint2022.

This paper takes a similar approach to "Noise fingerprints in quantum computers: Machine learning software tools" by Martina et al. @martinaLearningNoiseFingerprint2022 and utilizes the same quantum circuit.
However, instead of differentiating between various quantum computers, this paper creates machine learning models that distinguish whether a quantum circuit was executed by a QC or a simulator on a classical computer.

== Structure
@terms-and-definitions gives a short overview of the most important concepts of quantum computing and machine learning used in this paper.
In @approach, the dataset used for training different machine learning algorithms in order to differentiate whether a quantum circuit has been executed by a quantum computer or simulated by a classical computer.
Additionally, a white-box adversarial attack is performed.
After that, in @evaluation, the accuracies of the different machine learning algorithms are compared, and the limitations of this work are discussed, specifically concerning the white-box adversarial attack.
@future-work points out possible questions for further research.
At the end, @conclusion contains a short conclusion.


= Terms and Definitions <terms-and-definitions>
This section provides a brief introduction to quantum computing and machine learning ideas.

== Quantum Computing
A quantum computer leverages quantum bits (qubits).
Qubits have two basis states $|0 angle.r = [1, 0]^top$ and $|1 angle.r = [0, 1]^top$.
The notation with '$| med angle.r$' is called Dirac notation.
Classical bits are either 0 or 1.
Conversely, qubits can be in states other than $|0 angle.r$ and $|1 angle.r$.
A superposition is denoted as a linear combination of states, as in @superpositon-linear-combination.
#figure(
  $ |psi angle.r = alpha|0 angle.r + beta|1 angle.r $,
  caption: "A qubit state is written as a linear combination of the two basis states."
) <superpositon-linear-combination>
In @superpositon-linear-combination $alpha$ and $beta$ are complex values and describe probability amplitudes.
The probabilities must satisfy the normalization condition $|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2 = 1$.
It is possible to solve a specific selection of problems with reduced time and space complexity by leveraging quantum properties such as superposition, interference, and entanglement.
One example of such a quantum algorithm is Shor's algorithm @shorPolynomialTimeAlgorithmsPrime1997.
This paper's circuits consist of the Pauli-X gate, the Hadamard gate, the Controlled not gate (CNOT), and the Toffoli gate. Their respective circuit representation can be seen in @quantum-gates.
The Pauli-X gate performs a base flip on a single qubit.
The CNOT gate performs a base flip on the target qubit, depending on the state of the control qubit.
Similarly, the Toffoli gate has two control qubits, influencing whether the target qubit gets flipped.

    align(horizon, image("images/gates/ccx.svg", width: 30%))
  ),
  caption: "Quantum gates (from left to right): Pauli-X gate, Hadamard gate, Controlled not gate, Toffoli gate."
) <quantum-gates>
In quantum computing, measuring a qubit yields a binary outcome: either a $0$ or a $1$.
This measurement process is a critical operation that leads to the collapse of the qubit's wave function, situating it into a definitive state of either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$, depending on the measured value.
This collapse is a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical principle of wave function collapse, where measurement forces a quantum system to 'choose' a state from among the probabilities described by its wave function prior to measurement.
Additionally, the concept of "shots" in quantum computing refers to the number of iterations a quantum algorithm is executed.
The rationale behind multiple shots is to compile a statistical distribution of outcomes, which is instrumental in approximating the quantum state prior to measurement.
This statistical approach is crucial due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, where repeated executions help accurately estimate the likelihood of each possible outcome, thereby providing insight into the quantum system's behavior before measurement @nielsenQuantumComputationQuantum2010.

Different approaches exist for building physical quantum computers.
QCs built by IBM are based on superconducting qubit technology @QuantumSystemInformation.
Other architectures include trapped ions, photonics, and nuclear magnetic resonance @laddQuantumComputers2010.
Current quantum chips mainly suffer from decoherence, gate errors, readout errors, and crosstalk.
For a qubit, the decoherence time refers to how long the qubit can contain information.
Decoherence can occur, for example, when a qubit interacts with the environment.
When quantum computers are constructed from multiple qubits, unwanted interactions between these qubits are called crosstalk.

== Machine Learning
In this paper, the following supervised learning approaches are being utilized.

  caption: "SVM:"
) <svm>
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification and regression tasks.
It operates by constructing an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that separates different classes of data points.
This optimal hyperplane is determined by the data points, referred to as support vectors, that lie closest to the decision boundary, see @svm.
The hyperplane divides the input features into two distinct classes.
Its position and orientation are determined to maximize the margin or distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either class.
This approach ensures the best possible separation between classes and enhances the algorithm's generalization capabilities.
// TODO eventuell kÃ¼rzen??
However, real-world data is often not linearly separable.
To overcome this limitation, SVMs employ a technique known as the kernel trick.
A linear decision boundary can be found by mapping the input features into a higher dimensional feature space.
The kernel trick allows SVMs to construct a non-linear decision boundary in the original input space, thereby enabling the classification of complex datasets.
As a result, SVMs are computationally efficient and particularly suited for handling high-dimensional data.
See @cristianiniIntroductionSupportVector2000 for additional details.

=== Feedforward Neural Network
A feedforward neural network (FNN) is an artificial neural network commonly used for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition.
It passes input data through a series of interconnected layers of nodes, known as neurons or perceptrons, where each neuron performs a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to produce an output, which can be written as @perceptron-math.

#figure(
  $ y = f(sum_(i=1)^(n) w_i x_i + b) $,
  caption: "Equation for a single perceptron. y: output, f: activation function, w_i: weights for each input x_i, b: bias, n: number of inputs."
) <perceptron-math>

Each neural network consists of multiple neurons, which are grouped into layers.
The first layer, the input layer, receives the initial input data.
After the input layer, subsequent layers are known as hidden layers, where complex transformations of the input data occur.
Finally, the results are taken from the last layer, the output layer, which provides the network's final output.
See @feedforward-net for a visualization.

#figure(
  image("images/feedforward-neural-network.svg", height: 25%),
  caption: "Feedforward neural net"
) <feedforward-net>

During training, the network adjusts the weights of connections between neurons to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual targets, often using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent.
FNNs can learn complex patterns and relationships within data, making them suitable for various applications.
Various techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, can be employed to mitigate this issue and improve the generalization performance of the network.
FNNs offer flexibility and scalability, allowing them to handle diverse datasets and tasks effectively.
For additional information see @russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2021.

=== Convolutional Neural Network
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized artificial neural network primarily used for image recognition, classification, and computer vision tasks.
It employs convolutional layers that automatically learn hierarchical patterns and features from input images.
These convolutional layers consist of filters or kernels that slide across the input image, performing convolutions to extract local features.
CNNs typically consist of multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
The convolutional layers detect low-level features like edges and textures, while subsequent layers combine these features to recognize higher-level patterns and objects.
Pooling layers downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions of the data and increasing computational efficiency.
Finally, fully connected layers process the extracted features to make predictions or classifications.
During training, CNNs adjust the parameters of the filters through backpropagation, optimizing them to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels.
This process enables CNNs to effectively learn and generalize from large datasets.
CNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various applications, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
Their ability to automatically learn relevant features from raw input data and their hierarchical architecture make them well-suited for handling complex tasks.
For additional information see @russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2021.

=== Adversarial Attack
White-box adversarial attacks on neural networks operate under the premise that the attacker has complete knowledge of the model's architecture, weights, and training data.
This transparency allows the attacker to exploit specific vulnerabilities of the neural network.
The core idea behind these attacks is to craft input data that is only slightly modified from legitimate examples but is engineered to cause the neural network to make incorrect predictions.
Achieving this involves using gradient-based optimization techniques to adjust the input data.
The attacker calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input data, which provides information on how slight changes to the input can lead to significant increases in the loss.
By iteratively adjusting the input data in the direction of this gradient, the attacker can produce an adversarial example that is perceptually similar to the original data but results in a dramatically different and incorrect output when processed by the neural network.
This method relies on the differentiability of the neural network to efficiently compute gradients and craft adversarial examples that exploit the model's weaknesses, demonstrating the intricate balance between model transparency and vulnerability in the context of security.


= Approach <approach>
The methods mentioned in @related-work are used for fingerprinting, meaning they can predict which results originate from which quantum computer, but they cannot distinguish between a QC or a simulator.
This work therefore attempts to develop an approach that performs this differentiation.
In order to achieve this, only the measurement results of the quantum ciruits are considered.
Therefore this paper uses machine learing techniques to decide whether a quantum circuit was run on a quantum computer or simulated on a classical computer based on the circuit's measurement results.
The only precondition is that the data labels are correct (measurement results labeled as 'quantum computer data' have to be from an actual QC).

== Data for Training
The measurement results from a quantum computer  are taken from @martinaLearningQuantumNoiseFingerprint2023.
The reason being that no access to a quantum computer was available during the creation of this paper.
The QC data is the result of running the circuit described in @circuit on up to 8 different IBM quantum machines.
In the dataset it is clearly identifiable on which of the quantum computers the circuit was executed.
The simulation data for this work was created by simulating the identical quantum circuits from @martinaLearningQuantumNoiseFingerprint2023 with Qiskit @Qiskit2024.

=== Circuit <circuit>
The entire circuit looks like @circuit-complete.
In order to measure the circuit at different points, this circuit is executed until different points (steps) and a measurement of the qubits $q_2$ and $q_3$ is carried out after each step.

#figure(
  image("images/walker-step-9.svg"),
  caption: "Complete circuit with 4 qubits. Only the lower two qubits are being measured at the end. Grey separators mark points at which measurements can take place."
) <circuit-complete>

Due to the wavefunction collapse, a new circuit has to be executed and measured for each measurement step.
The entire process is shown in @circuit-steps.
#figure(
  grid(
    columns: 2,
    image("images/walker-step-1.svg", width: auto, height: auto),
    image("images/walker-step-2.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-3.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-4.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-5.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-6.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-7.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-8.svg"),
    image("images/walker-step-9.svg"),
    ),
  caption: "Circuit with different point at which they get measured."
) <circuit-steps>

This results in 9 measurement points for this circuit.
Each circuit run has been performed with 8000 shots.
For one circuit run with 8000 shots the measurement results look like @measurement-data-table.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),
    align: horizon,
    [*Shot*], [*Step 1*], [*step 2*], [*step 3*], [*...*], [*step 9*],
    [1], [$10_2$], [$00_2$], [$11_2$], [...], [$00_2$],
    [2], [$11_2$], [$01_2$], [$10_2$], [...], [$11_2$],
    [...], [...], [...], [...], [...], [...],
    [8000], [$01_2$], [$00_2$], [$00_2$], [...], [$10_2$]
  ), 
  caption: "Measurement examples for one run with 8000 shots. There exist 250 measurement tables for each quantum computer."
) <measurement-data-table>

=== Executions on Simulator
To obtain the simulated data, 7 different Qiskit simulators are utilized.
Only one backend calculates a noise free result, because the variance is caused by the noise but different simulator implementations deliver very similar results.
In order to obtain a comparable order of magnitude of simulated data to that of QC generated data, 6 additional simulators with noise are used.
All of the 6 backends are each utilizing a different noise model which is based on calibration data from real IBM quantum computers @Fake_provider.

== Machine Learning Approaches
The basic approach makes use of machine learning algorithms to distinguish whether a quantum circuit was executed on a QC or a simulator.
As a first approach, different ML algorithms were trained with the unpreprocessed measurement data.
In each case, the complete data set for a measurement point (step) over 8000 shots (i.e. 8000 individual values) was used as an input.
The individual steps are considered completely independently of each other.
In particular, 8000 input neurons had to be used for the artificial neural net.

As a second approach, the data has been preprocessed before machine learning algorithms were applied to it.
For this purpose, the probability values per step were calculated for the four possible result values ($00_2$, $01_2$, $10_2$, $11_2$).
Only these probability values are used as input for the ML algorithms.
When considering a step > 1, the probability values of the previous steps were also used.
This means that step 1 has 4 input values, step 2 has 8 (the 4 unchanged values from step 1 and the 4 additional probabilities from step 2), step 3 has 12 and so on. (See @probability-calculation-table-step-1 and @probability-calculation-table-steps-1-and-2)

This second approach also examines whether the 8000 shots can be meaningfully divided into smaller packages.
This has the advantage that more test and training data packages can be formed from the data available for this work.

// TODO remove casablanca-bis from qc?

// hier "beste" fÃ¤lle zeigen
// zeige sowohl "gemischtes ausschlieÃen", als auch "mehrere Quantencomputer ausschlieÃen"
// TODO ohne manche simulator trainieren (erkennt er einen unbekannten simulator)

== Limitations
// TODO nur eingeschrÃ¤nkt richtig
// possible to detect the circuit and route it (maybe to another provider for correct results).
// To counteract this: embed the circuit inside the "real circuit". (uses only 4 qubits of possibly larger quantum computer)

= Future Work <future-work>
Short, what would I improve if I had infinitely more time?
