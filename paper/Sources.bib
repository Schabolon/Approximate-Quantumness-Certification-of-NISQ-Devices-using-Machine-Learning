	title = {Fast {Fingerprinting} of {Cloud}-based {NISQ} {Quantum} {Computers}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07880},
	abstract = {Cloud-based quantum computers have become a reality with a number of companies allowing for cloud-based access to their machines with tens to more than 100 qubits. With easy access to quantum computers, quantum information processing will potentially revolutionize computation, and superconducting transmon-based quantum computers are among some of the more promising devices available. Cloud service providers today host a variety of these and other prototype quantum computers with highly diverse device properties, sizes, and performances. The variation that exists in today's quantum computers, even among those of the same underlying hardware, motivate the study of how one device can be clearly differentiated and identified from the next. As a case study, this work focuses on the properties of 25 IBM superconducting, fixed-frequency transmon-based quantum computers that range in age from a few months to approximately 2.5 years. Through the analysis of current and historical quantum computer calibration data, this work uncovers key features within the machines that can serve as basis for unique hardware fingerprint of each quantum computer. This work demonstrates a new and fast method to reliably fingerprint cloud-based quantum computers based on unique frequency characteristics of transmon qubits. Both enrollment and recall operations are very fast as fingerprint data can be generated with minimal executions on the quantum machine. The qubit frequency-based fingerprints also have excellent inter-device separation and intra-device stability.},

NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away --- we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future.

Various companies such as, IBM, Rigetti and D-Wave offer quantum computers using a cloud-based platform that possess several interesting features. These factors motivate a new threat model. To mitigate this threat, we propose two flavors of QuPUF: one based on superposition, and another based on decoherence. Experiments on real IBM quantum hardware show that the proposed QuPUF can achieve inter-die Hamming Distance(HD) of 55\% and intra-HD as low as 4\%, as compared to ideal cases of 50\% and 0\% respectively. The proposed QuPUFs can also be used as a standalone solution for any other application.},

Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},
