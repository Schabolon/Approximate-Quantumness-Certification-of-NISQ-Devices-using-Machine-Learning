	title = {Fast {Fingerprinting} of {Cloud}-based {NISQ} {Quantum} {Computers}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07880},
	abstract = {Cloud-based quantum computers have become a reality with a number of companies allowing for cloud-based access to their machines with tens to more than 100 qubits. With easy access to quantum computers, quantum information processing will potentially revolutionize computation, and superconducting transmon-based quantum computers are among some of the more promising devices available. Cloud service providers today host a variety of these and other prototype quantum computers with highly diverse device properties, sizes, and performances. The variation that exists in today's quantum computers, even among those of the same underlying hardware, motivate the study of how one device can be clearly differentiated and identified from the next. As a case study, this work focuses on the properties of 25 IBM superconducting, fixed-frequency transmon-based quantum computers that range in age from a few months to approximately 2.5 years. Through the analysis of current and historical quantum computer calibration data, this work uncovers key features within the machines that can serve as basis for unique hardware fingerprint of each quantum computer. This work demonstrates a new and fast method to reliably fingerprint cloud-based quantum computers based on unique frequency characteristics of transmon qubits. Both enrollment and recall operations are very fast as fingerprint data can be generated with minimal executions on the quantum machine. The qubit frequency-based fingerprints also have excellent inter-device separation and intra-device stability.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to perform certain tasks that are believed to be intractable to classical computers. Boson sampling is such a task and is considered a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We performed Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples were validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1014.},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

Computing ideal quantum state amplitudes for circuits of such and larger sizes is a fundamental step to assess both the correctness, performance, and scaling behavior of quantum algorithms and the fidelities of quantum devices. However, resource requirements for such calculations on classical computers grow exponentially. We show that deferring tensor contractions can extend the boundaries of what can be computed on classical systems. To demonstrate this technique, we present results obtained from a calculation of the complete set of output amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 27 in a 2D lattice of \$7 {\textbackslash}times 7\$ qubits, and an arbitrarily selected slice of \$2{\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$ amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 23 in a 2D lattice of \$8 {\textbackslash}times 7\$ qubits. Combining our methodology with other decomposition approaches found in the literature, we show that we can simulate \$7 {\textbackslash}times 7\$-qubit random circuits to arbitrary depth by leveraging secondary storage. These calculations were thought to be impossible due to resource requirements.},

We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation to this date.

We harness measurements and strong couplings to dynamically disconnect different groups of quantum states and constrain the atoms to coherently evolve inside a two-level subregion. In parallel to the foundational importance due to the realization of a dynamical superselection rule and the theory of quantum measurements, this is an important step forward in protecting and controlling quantum dynamics and, broadly speaking, quantum information processing.},

Quantum systems with sufficiently uncorrelated and weak noise could be used to solve computational problems that are intractable with current digital computers. There has been substantial progress towards engineering such systems. However, continued progress depends on the ability to characterize quantum noise reliably and efficiently with high precision. Here we describe such a protocol and report its experimental implementation on a 14-qubit superconducting quantum architecture. The method returns an estimate of the effective noise and can detect correlations within arbitrary sets of qubits. We show how to construct a quantum noise correlation matrix allowing the easy visualization of correlations between all pairs of qubits, enabling the discovery of long-range two-qubit correlations in the 14 qubit device that had not previously been detected. Our results are the first implementation of a provably rigorous and comprehensive diagnostic protocol capable of being run on state of the art devices and beyond. These results pave the way for noise metrology in next-generation quantum devices, calibration in the presence of crosstalk, bespoke quantum error-correcting codes, and customized fault-tolerance protocols that can greatly reduce the overhead in a quantum computation.},
